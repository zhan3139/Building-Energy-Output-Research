# Building-Energy-Output-Research

Hi! Welcome! 

This project page was created by Andy Zhang as a homebase for his team's code and other work. Much of the code you'll see here are applications of ML to predict energy 
outputs for a system. The hope is that this system can be defined as an entire building, but you can see our progress as we work our way there. Hopefully, everything
you need to understand how our code works will be documented alongside relevant lines. 

If you have any questions, you can reach me at zhan3139@purdue.edu

My most recent code and test dataset are attached. The rest of my team has not uploaded their models here yet.
